                <p>
                    I am a Software Engineer at Cisco, experienced in embedded systems development.
                    I also have experience in fullstack web development, and machine learning.

                    I love to keep learning and growing. As a result, I have gathered knowledge in a breadth of topics!
                    Jack of all trades, master of none (maybe one ðŸ˜‰)!
